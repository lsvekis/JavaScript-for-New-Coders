Variable Scavenger Hunt:


Create variables for your favorite movie, hobby, and sport.
Use console.log() to display them in a creative sentence.
Example:
let favoriteMovie = "The Lion King";
let hobby = "drawing";
let sport = "soccer";
console.log("I love watching " + favoriteMovie + ", " + hobby + " in my free time, and playing " + sport + " on weekends!");
Number Cruncher Challenge:


Create two number variables and perform different arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Example:
let a = 20;
let b = 4;
console.log("Addition: " + (a + b));
console.log("Subtraction: " + (a - b));
console.log("Multiplication: " + (a * b));
console.log("Division: " + (a / b));
Text Mashup:


Declare variables for a greeting, your name, and a fun fact.
Use string concatenation to create a sentence.
Example:
let greeting = "Hey there!";
let myName = "Taylor";
let funFact = "I can solve a Rubik's Cube in under a minute.";
console.log(greeting + " I'm " + myName + ". Did you know? " + funFact);
Variable Quiz:


Write a small program that declares three variables.
Ask the user to predict what the console.log() statement will output.
Then, run the code to check their prediction.
Example:
let x = 5;
let y = 10;
let result = x * y;
console.log("The result is: " + result);
Mad Libs Remix:


Modify the Mad Libs game from above.
Add extra variables (like a second adjective or a verb) to make the story longer and even more entertaining.
Example:
let adjective1 = "brave";
let adjective2 = "mysterious";
let noun = "wizard";
let verb = "casts";
let object = "spells";
let place = "enchanted forest";
let extendedStory = "In a " + adjective1 + " and " + adjective2 + " land, a " + noun + " " + verb + " powerful " + object + " in the " + place + ".";
console.log(extendedStory);
