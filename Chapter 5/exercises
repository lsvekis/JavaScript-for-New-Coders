Exercise 1: Build Your Dream List
Task: Create an array of your top five favorite movies or video games.
Activity: Use console.log() to display the entire list and then print the first and last items separately.
Starter Code:
let favorites = ["Movie1", "Movie2", "Movie3", "Movie4", "Movie5"];
console.log("All favorites:", favorites);
console.log("First favorite:", favorites[0]);
console.log("Last favorite:", favorites[favorites.length - 1]);
Exercise 2: Snack Attack!
Task: Make an array of your favorite snacks. Then, add a new snack to the beginning and remove the last snack.
Activity: Observe how the array changes with unshift() and pop().
Starter Code:
let snacks = ["Chips", "Cookies", "Pretzels"];
snacks.unshift("Fruit Snack"); // Add at beginning
console.log("After unshift:", snacks);
snacks.pop(); // Remove the last item
console.log("After pop:", snacks);
Exercise 3: Array Splice Fun
Task: Create an array of numbers from 1 to 5. Use splice() to remove the third number and insert a new number (e.g., 99) in its place.
Activity: Print the array before and after using splice().
Starter Code:
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log("Before splice:", numbers);
numbers.splice(2, 1, 99);  // Remove 1 element at index 2 and insert 99
console.log("After splice:", numbers);
Exercise 4: Slice Out a Subset
Task: Create an array of letters and use slice() to extract a portion of the array (for example, letters from index 2 to 5).
Activity: Display the original array and the new sliced array.
Starter Code:
let letters = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G"];
let subset = letters.slice(2, 6); // Extract from index 2 to 5
console.log("Original letters:", letters);
console.log("Sliced subset:", subset);
Exercise 5: Search for Treasure
Task: Create an array of random words. Ask the user (or set a variable) for a word to find and use indexOf() to search for it.
Activity: Display a message if the word is found and at what position, or inform the user if it isnâ€™t found.
Starter Code:
let words = ["treasure", "island", "ship", "ocean", "map"];
let searchWord = "ship"; // You can change this word
let position = words.indexOf(searchWord);
if (position !== -1) {
  console.log(searchWord + " found at position " + position);
} else {
  console.log(searchWord + " not found in the array.");
}
