Sample 1: Creating an Array of Colors
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
console.log("Colors:", colors);
Sample 2: Using push() to Add an Element
let fruits = ["apple", "banana"];
fruits.push("orange");
console.log("Fruits:", fruits);
Sample 3: Removing an Element with pop()
let cities = ["New York", "Paris", "Tokyo"];
let removedCity = cities.pop();
console.log("Removed City:", removedCity);
console.log("Remaining Cities:", cities);
Sample 4: Adding an Element with unshift()
let animals = ["dog", "cat"];
animals.unshift("elephant");
console.log("Animals:", animals);
Sample 5: Removing the First Element with shift()
let instruments = ["guitar", "piano", "drums"];
let firstInstrument = instruments.shift();
console.log("Removed Instrument:", firstInstrument);
console.log("Remaining Instruments:", instruments);
Sample 6: Replacing Elements with splice()
let numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40];
numbers.splice(1, 2, 99, 100); // Removes 20 and 30, inserts 99 and 100 at index 1
console.log("Numbers after splice:", numbers);
Sample 7: Extracting a Subarray with slice()
let letters = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E"];
let subLetters = letters.slice(1, 4); // Extracts "B", "C", "D"
console.log("Subarray:", subLetters);
Sample 8: Finding an Element's Index with indexOf()
let pets = ["dog", "cat", "parrot"];
let petIndex = pets.indexOf("cat");
console.log("Index of cat:", petIndex);
Sample 9: Combining Arrays with concat()
let array1 = [1, 2, 3];
let array2 = [4, 5, 6];
let combined = array1.concat(array2);
console.log("Combined Array:", combined);
Sample 10: Random Joke Teller Project
let jokes = [
  "What do you call a bear with no teeth? A gummy bear!",
  "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!",
  "How do you organize a space party? You planet!",
  "What do you call a fake noodle? An impasta!",
  "Why did the bicycle fall over? It was two tired!"
];
let randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * jokes.length);
console.log("Here's a joke for you: " + jokes[randomIndex]);
