Exercise 1: Simple Counter Challenge
Task: Write a loop that counts from 1 to 20.
Activity: Modify the starting and ending points to see how the loop changes.
Starter Code:
for (let i = 1; i <= 20; i++) {
  console.log("Count: " + i);
}
Exercise 2: Even Numbers Finder
Task: Create a loop that prints only even numbers between 1 and 30.
Activity: Experiment with different ranges.
Starter Code:
for (let i = 1; i <= 30; i++) {
  if (i % 2 === 0) {
    console.log("Even number: " + i);
  }
}
Exercise 3: While Loop Countdown
Task: Build a while loop that counts down from 10 to 1.
Activity: Try adjusting the loop so it stops at different numbers.
Starter Code:
let count = 10;
while (count >= 1) {
  console.log("Countdown: " + count);
  count--;
}
console.log("Blast off!");
Exercise 4: Random Number Guess Loop
Task: Create a loop that keeps generating a random number until it equals a target number (e.g., 5).
Activity: Notice how many tries it takes to get the target.
Starter Code:
let target = 5;
let randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;
while (randomNumber !== target) {
  console.log("Generated: " + randomNumber);
  randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;
}
console.log("Got the target number: " + target);
Exercise 5: Nested Loop Pattern Drawing
Task: Use a nested loop to draw a simple pattern (like a rectangle of stars).
Activity: Experiment with different shapes and sizes.
Starter Code:
let rows = 5;
let cols = 10;
for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
  let line = "";
  for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
    line += "* ";
  }
  console.log(line);
}
